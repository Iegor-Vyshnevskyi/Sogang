# 1. Future Challenges for Central Banks

---
# Introduction

- The world economy is becoming increasingly complex, uncertain, and interdependent.

- Central banks must evolve to meet new challenges, from AI to climate change, from high debt levels to fragile financial markets.

- In this lecture, we will explore:
  - The macroeconomic and structural pressures confronting central banks
  - Technological, fiscal, geopolitical, and demographic factors driving complexity
  - The role of innovation, data, and collaboration in shaping the central bank of the future

---

# Structural Shifts Affecting Central Banks

- **Persistent High Debt Levels**: Constrains monetary policy space.

- **Ageing Populations**: Alters savings-investment dynamics.

- **Climate Change**: Increases exposure to shocks and transition risk.

- **Low Productivity Growth**: Sustains low equilibrium interest rates.

- **Digitalization**: Alters monetary transmission mechanisms.

.pull-right[
- Global debt levels surged during the COVID-19 crisis, peaking at **258% of GDP in 2020**.

- In 2024, debt remains elevated at **237% of global GDP**, showing only partial unwinding.

- The composition of debt in 2023:
  - **Public debt**: 94% of GDP
  - **Non-financial corporate (NFC) debt**: 90%
  - **Household debt**: 54%

- High debt levels limit central banks’ policy space and pose risks to financial stability.

- Fiscal and monetary coordination is becoming increasingly critical.

# Technological Disruption

- Rise of AI and big data introduces new analytical possibilities and operational tools.

- Machine learning is now used for:
  - Forecasting inflation and output
  - Early warning systems for financial instability
  - Real-time policy evaluation

- Central banks must build digital skills and governance frameworks.

.pull-right[
- **Panel A**: The number of disclosed cyberattacks has grown steadily since 2014, with steep increases in recent years.

- **Panel B**: A surge in open-source AI models and public interest in “Cyber attack and AI” followed the launch of ChatGPT.

- **Panel C**: Stock prices of cybersecurity and AI firms outperformed the broader market, highlighting investor confidence.

- These dynamics reflect the growing centrality of AI and cybersecurity in financial market expectations and regulatory focus.

# Climate Change and Central Banks

- Physical and transition risks impact financial stability and inflation.

- Growing use of climate stress testing in financial supervision.

- Some central banks integrating green objectives via disclosure rules, asset purchases, or collateral policies.

- Balancing mandates remains a key challenge.

---

# Global Uncertainty and Monetary Policy

- Volatile financial markets, trade fragmentation, and geopolitical tensions cloud forecasts.

- Uncertainty discourages investment and dampens transmission of policy signals.

- Communication strategies are more important than ever to anchor expectations.

# Monetary Policy Divergence

]

.pull-right[
- **US Federal Reserve**: Likely to raise rates by 25 bps in November; September hike also possible due to strong activity and tight labor market.

- **European Central Bank**: Likely done with hikes; focus shifting to balance sheet reduction.

- **Advanced Economies**: Rate cuts expected mid-2024.

- **Emerging Economies**: Some already cutting rates as anticipated.

# Governance and Mandates

- Expanding roles risk overburdening central banks and blurring accountability.

- Need for clarity on primary vs. secondary objectives (e.g. price stability vs. climate support).

- Institutional reforms needed to align mandates with capacities.

.pull-right[
- Central banks today face **dual challenges**:
  - **Mandate Expansion Pressures**: Rising expectations to address climate, fintech, financial inclusion, and digital currency.
  - **Framework Resilience Tests**: Responding to a world of low growth, fragmentation, and extreme uncertainty.

- This complex policy environment calls for a strategic rethinking of tools, objectives, and institutional design.
