# Quick Icebreaker

## Why does a cup of coffee cost $0.60 in one country and $5 in another?

# Possible reasons

- **Cost of production**: labor, rent, utilities, etc.

- **Demand**: local preferences, income levels, etc.

- **Competition**: number of suppliers, market structure, etc.

- **Regulations**: import/export restrictions, quality standards, etc.

- **Cultural factors**: coffee traditions, social norms, etc.

- **Purchasing power**: A $1 in Korea buys much more than in Sweden due to differences in living costs and wages.

- **Exchange rates**: currency value, inflation, etc.

???
Central Bank Influence

Interest rates, inflation control, and monetary policy shape price levels and currency values. 
Central banks play a key role in managing these factors to ensure price stability and economic growth.

# 3. Why Central Banking?

---

# Introduction

- The origins of central banks vary, leading to different roles and functions.

  - Some started as government banks issuing banknotes.

  - Others were large commercial banks later granted monopoly rights.

  - Most modern central banks were created in the 20th century for policy functions.

---

# Defining Central Banks

- A central bank conducts **monetary policy** and provides the **means of settlement**.

- The exact functions differ across countries.

- Modern central banks are increasingly defined by **objectives rather than functions**.

---

# Objectives vs. Functions

- Central banks have historically been understood in terms of **functions** rather than **objectives**.

- Some core functions lack clear objectives.
  - Example: **Financial stability** objectives are often less well-defined than monetary policy objectives.

- Over time, more central banks have shifted towards **explicitly stated objectives**.
  - Example: **Inflation targeting** is a common objective.

---

# Specifying Objectives

- A trend towards defining **monetary policy objectives** has emerged.

- Price stability is now the **primary monetary objective** in most countries.
  - Few central banks operate without an explicit price stability goal.

**Assignment:**  
- Identify a central bank that does **not** explicitly mention price stability in its objectives.

---

# Monetary Policy Objectives - Price Stability

- Price stability is the **dominant monetary policy objective** in legislation.

  - It is often a **singular objective** or prioritized over other macroeconomic goals.

- **Inflation targeting** is the most common approach to price stability.

---

# Potential Conflicts in Policy Objectives

- **Conflicts arise when multiple policy goals exist.**
  - Example: Price stability vs. employment goals.

- The **Phillips Curve** debate:
  - Short-term trade-offs exist between inflation and unemployment.
  - Over the long term, inflation targeting dominates.


*Phillips Curve*: It shows a trade-off between inflation and unemployment. 

---

# Central Bank Independence

- Monetary policy autonomy is greater when central banks focus on a **single** macroeconomic objective.

- Countries with independent central banks (e.g., UK, Canada) typically follow **inflation targeting**.

---

# Financial Stability Objectives

- Most central banks assume responsibility for **financial stability**, but many lack **explicit legal mandates**.

- **BIS findings:**  
  - Less than half of central bank laws mention **financial stability** as a core objective.

---

# Financial Stability: Challenges

- Financial stability is **not an absolute objective**.
  - The degree of acceptable risk and flexibility varies.

- No universally accepted **financial stability metric**.
  - Makes accountability and policy effectiveness harder to measure.

---

# The Functions of a Modern Central Bank

1. **Monetary stability** – Setting interest rates, controlling inflation.  

2. **Financial stability** – Supervising banks, managing systemic risks.  

3. **Foreign exchange policy** – Currency interventions, FX reserves.  

4. **Infrastructure provision** – Issuing currency, maintaining payment systems.  

5. **Other roles** – Asset management, economic research.

---

# Case Study: Bank of Korea

**Bank of Korea Act** (Article 1)  
1. The central bank pursues **price stability** to support economic development.  

2. It also considers **financial stability** in policy decisions.

---

# Case Study: Federal Reserve (U.S.)

**Federal Reserve Act (Section 2A):**  
- The Fed aims to maintain **long-run monetary growth** aligned with economic output.  

- Its primary goals:  
  - **Maximum employment**  
  - **Stable prices**  
  - **Moderate long-term interest rates**

---

# The Fed’s Monetary Policy Strategy

- The Fed commits to **inflation targeting** at 2%.  

- Seeks to achieve **inflation averaging 2% over time**.  

- After periods of low inflation, it may **allow inflation to rise slightly above 2%** (Averaged Targeting).

---

# Market Reactions and Policy Misinterpretation

- December 2023:  
  - Fed Chair **Jay Powell** emphasized high rates until inflation is controlled.  
  - Markets still expect **rate cuts** due to falling inflation.

- **Key takeaway:**  
  - Market expectations don’t always align with central bank intentions.

---

# Summary  

- **Price stability** is the core objective of most central banks.

- **Financial stability** remains an evolving objective.

- Central bank policies adapt to **economic changes and market expectations**.

- Emerging topics: **Climate risk, digital currencies, AI in monetary policy**.
