# 1. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)

---

# Introduction

- Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are digital forms of a nation's fiat currency issued by the central bank.

- The emergence of CBDCs is driven by the rise of cryptocurrencies and the need for more efficient payment systems.

- This lecture will cover:
  - The concept and design of CBDCs.
  - The motivations and implications for central banks.
  - Case studies of CBDC implementation globally.
  - Challenges and risks associated with CBDCs.

---

# What is a CBDC?

- A digital form of a central bank-issued currency.

- Can be account-based or token-based.

- Unlike cryptocurrencies, CBDCs are state-backed and represent legal tender.

# Key Features of CBDCs

- **Legal Tender:** Recognized as a valid form of payment.

- **Central Bank Backing:** Issued and regulated by the central bank.

- **Digital Nature:** Exists only in digital form, not physical cash.

- **Programmability:** Potential for smart contracts and programmable money.

- **Interoperability:** Ability to work across different payment systems and platforms.

- **Privacy and Security:** Balancing user privacy with transaction traceability.

- **Accessibility:** Ensuring that all citizens can access and use the CBDC.

- **Resilience:** Robust against cyber threats and operational risks.

- **Monetary Policy Tool:** Potential to enhance monetary policy transmission and financial stability.

- **Cross-Border Payments:** Facilitating international transactions and remittances.

---

# Motivations for CBDCs

- Increase financial inclusion.

- Improve payment systems.

- Enhance monetary policy transmission.

- Counteract private digital currencies.

- Strengthen financial stability.

# CBDC Design Models

- **Account-Based:**
  - Linked to user identity.
  - Similar to bank accounts but managed by central banks.

- **Token-Based:**
  - Digital tokens serve as the medium of exchange.
  - Anonymity and offline transactions possible.

- **Hybrid Model:**
  - Combines features of both account-based and token-based systems.
  - Users can hold accounts with the central bank and also use digital tokens.

---

# Case Study: China's Digital Yuan

- Pioneering CBDC project globally.

- Launched to counteract the dominance of private cryptocurrencies.

- Focus on domestic retail payments.

- Emphasizes controlled data privacy and transaction tracking.

- Pilot programs in major cities.

---

# Digital Yuan: Current Status in 2025

- The Digital Yuan has been rolled out in **29 cities**, shifting from pilot testing to full-scale implementation.

- Despite significant state backing, adoption remains limited due to the dominance of **Alipay and WeChat Pay**.

- Payment volumes have increased but still constitute only **0.16% of total monetary volume**:
  - 2023 H1: **$250 billion in transactions**
  - 2024: Cumulative transactions reached **$7.3 trillion**, with 180 million e-CNY wallets created.

- **Hong Kong** has also begun accepting the e-CNY, with state media promoting its use.

---

# Risks and Challenges of CBDCs

- Cybersecurity threats and data privacy.

- Financial disintermediation and impact on banking sector.

- Operational risks and technology implementation.

- Cross-border implications and international coordination.

---

# Example: eNaira in Nigeria

- Implemented by the Central Bank of Nigeria (Ozili, 2023).

- Aimed to promote financial inclusion and reduce reliance on cash.

- Key challenges:
  - Digital literacy.
  - Security concerns.
  - Public trust in digital currency.

---

# CBDC and Monetary Policy

- Potential to enhance monetary policy transmission.

- Direct control over digital currency issuance.

- Faster policy implementation through programmable money.

---

# Conclusion

- CBDCs represent a significant evolution in monetary policy and financial stability.

- While they offer potential benefits, they also present unique risks and operational challenges.

- The future of CBDCs will depend on effective governance, technology infrastructure, and international coordination.
