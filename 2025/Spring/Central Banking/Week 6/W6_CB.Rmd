# Introduction

- Welcome to today's lecture on **Exchange Rate Regimes and Currency Stability** — an essential topic in understanding the broader role of central banks. 

- Exchange rates impact inflation, trade competitiveness, financial stability, and capital flows — all of which shape a country’s macroeconomic environment.

- Today we’ll explore how central banks intervene in foreign exchange markets, the rationale behind their actions, and how they design strategies and choose instruments to maintain currency stability. 

- This lecture draws on the BIS Paper by Patel & Cavallino (2019) and incorporates real-world practices from advanced and emerging market economies.

---

# Why Exchange Rate Stability Matters

- Vital for price stability, financial stability, external balance

- Especially important for **emerging market economies (EMEs)**

- Volatile capital flows and terms of trade create policy tension

---

# Objectives

- Understand exchange rate regimes

- Explore FX intervention goals and strategies

- Evaluate effectiveness and transmission channels

- Discuss central banks' tactics and tools

- Reflect on modern challenges and policy trade-offs

---

# **Agenda for Today**

# 1. Exchange Rate Regimes and Currency Stability

---


# Are Exchange Rates Within the Realm of Central Banks?

**Question for Discussion:**

- To what extent should central banks influence or control exchange rates?

**Considerations:**

- Central banks' mandates often include price stability, full employment, and economic growth.

- Exchange rate stability can impact inflation, trade balances, and financial stability.

---

# Historical Example – The Bank of England and Black Wednesday (1992)

**Context:**

- In 1992, the UK was part of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), aiming to maintain currency stability among European nations.

**Central Bank Action:**

- The Bank of England intervened by spending billions of pounds in an attempt to prop up the depreciating pound and keep it within the ERM limits.

**Outcome:**

- Despite the intervention, the pound couldn't be maintained within the ERM bands, leading to the UK's exit from the mechanism on September 16, 1992, known as "Black Wednesday."

---

# Historical Example – Swiss National Bank's Currency Cap (2011–2015)

**Context:**

- Post-2008 financial crisis, the Swiss franc appreciated significantly due to its safe-haven status.

**Central Bank Action:**

- In 2011, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) set a minimum exchange rate of 1.20 CHF per euro to curb the franc's overvaluation and protect the economy.

**Outcome:**

- The SNB maintained this cap until 2015, when it was abruptly removed, leading to a sharp appreciation of the franc.

---

# Current Example – Bank of Japan's Interest Rate Policies (2024)

**Context:**

- In response to prolonged low inflation and economic stagnation, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) maintained low-interest rates.

**Central Bank Action:**

- In July 2024, the BOJ raised interest rates to 0.25%, aiming to strengthen the yen and control inflation.

**Outcome:**

- The yen strengthened sharply in subsequent days, illustrating the impact of central bank policies on exchange rates.

---

# Current Example – Central Bank of Brazil's Dollar Intervention (December 2024)

**Context:**

- Facing significant currency depreciation pressures, Brazil's central bank intervened in the foreign exchange market.

**Central Bank Action:**

- In December 2024, the Central Bank of Brazil sold $21.57 billion in the spot market, marking its largest monthly intervention since adopting a floating exchange rate in 1999.

**Outcome:**

- The intervention aimed to stabilize the Brazilian real amidst substantial dollar outflows.

---

# Conclusion

- Central banks play a pivotal role in influencing exchange rates through various interventions and policy decisions.

- Historical and current examples illustrate the complexities and impacts of such actions on national and global economies.

# Types of Exchange Rate Regimes

| Regime Type         | Example         | Central Bank Role        |
|---------------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| Fixed / Pegged      | Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia | Maintain parity using reserves |
| Managed Float       | India, Indonesia | Intervene as needed       |
| Free Float          | US, Eurozone     | Market-determined         |

# Central Bank Goals for FX Intervention

- **Price Stability**

- **Curb Speculation**

- **Build Reserves**

- **Smooth Capital Flows**

- **Financial Stability**

- **External Competitiveness**

> _More than half of EM central banks intervene to support price stability_  
— Patel & Cavallino (2019)

---

# Intermediate Objectives

- Limit **exchange rate volatility**

- Provide **liquidity** in thin FX markets

- Influence **trend path** of exchange rates

- Smooth **capital flow pressures**

---

# Effectiveness of FX Intervention

- Mostly short-term (under 1 month)

- Medium-term effects if repeated

- Long-term effectiveness is limited

> FX intervention affects expectations via **signaling** and **portfolio balance** channels.

---

# Transmission Channels

.pull-left[
### Portfolio Balance
- Assets not perfect substitutes  

- Reserve changes shift demand

### Signaling
- Interventions signal future policy  

- Impact expectations and behavior

# Instruments of Intervention

- Spot market (most common)

- FX **swaps**, **forwards**, **options**

- Onshore vs offshore

### Recent trends:
- Greater use of derivatives

- Preference for discretion over rules

---

# Sterilization Techniques

- Central bank securities (most common)

- Reserve requirements (less frequent)

- Government deposits

> Market-based tools are also seen as aiding **market development**

---

# Communication Strategies

- Most interventions are **not pre-announced**

- Latin America more transparent than Asia

- Some interventions use **rules**, but most are discretionary

---

# Central Banks’ Strategic Choices

- **Timing**: reactive vs preemptive

- **Transparency**: signal vs surprise

- **Objectives**: reserves, stability, signaling, liquidity

---

# Trade-offs in Exchange Rate Policy

.pull-left[
## Stability vs Flexibility
- Intervening too much can distort markets

- Too little can allow volatility to damage stability

## Growth vs Inflation
- FX moves can impact both

# Mini Case: Bank Indonesia (2018)

- Tight global financial conditions

- Rupiah depreciation pressure

- Used FX intervention to stabilize markets

- Conducted NDFs to deepen local hedging market

---

# Discussion Points

- Should FX interventions always be sterilized?

- What is the role of communication in FX interventions?

- How can central banks judge the **right** time to intervene?

---

# Key Takeaways

- Exchange rate regimes shape CB behavior

- FX interventions serve **multiple goals**

- Effectiveness is often **short-term**

- Tools and transparency matter

- Trade-offs must be managed wisely
