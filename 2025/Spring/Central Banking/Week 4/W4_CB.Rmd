# Introduction

- The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) highlighted the need for **macroprudential** surveillance

- Central banks play a key role in **system-wide risk monitoring** and **financial regulation**

- Today’s topic: How central banks contribute to **financial stability**, with a focus on **Asian economies**

---

# **Agenda for Today**

1. **Central Banking and Financial Stability**

2. **Guest speaker from the National Bank of Ukraine**

3. **In-class group activity**

# What is Financial Stability?

- **Financial stability** refers to a **stable financial system** that can withstand economic shocks.

- **Key components:**
  - **Resilience:** Ability to withstand / absorb shocks without disruption.
  - **Robustness:** Soundness of financial institutions and markets.
  - **Smooth functioning:** Efficient allocation of resources.
  - **Sustainability:** Long-term stability and growth.

- **Why is financial stability important?**

# You can picture financial stability as a **three-legged stool**:

# Systemic Risk & Macroprudential Policy

- **Systemic Risk**: Disruption to financial services causing serious harm to the economy

- **Macroprudential Policy** aims to:
  - Limit procyclicality
  - Address interconnectedness
  - Increase system-wide resilience

---

# Why is This Relevant in Asia?

- Asia’s emerging markets:
  - Vulnerable to **volatile capital flows**
  - Still developing institutional capacity
  - History of **1997 Asian crisis** & **2008 GFC**

---

# Central Banks & Financial Stability

## Traditional vs Financial Stability Mandates

| Mandate | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Price Stability | Control inflation (e.g. CPI targets) |
| Financial Stability | Prevent asset bubbles, systemic failures |
| Dual Mandate | Balance price and financial stability |
| Multiple Mandates | Include growth, employment, etc. |

**Key challenge**: **Trade-offs** between mandates

- Debate: Do the two goals conflict?

---

# Tools of Central Banks for Financial Stability

## Macroprudential Policy and Tools


- **Macroprudential policy** - regulation of the financial system as a whole to prevent systemic risk and stabilize the economy / the financial system.

- Examples:
  - **Capital requirements** (e.g., Basel III) to ensure banks have enough capital to absorb losses 
  - **Leverage ratios** to limit excessive borrowing
  - **Liquidity requirements** (e.g., LCR and NSFR) to ensure banks can meet obligations
  - **Stress tests** to assess resilience to shocks
  - **Countercyclical buffers** to build up capital in good times
  - **Loan-to-value ratios** (LTV) to limit excessive lending
  - **Loan-to-income ratios** (LTI) to limit excessive borrowing
  - **Debt-service-to-income ratios** (DTI, aka DSTI) to limit excessive borrowing

---

# Asia’s Experience

## Examples of Macroprudential Tools

| Country | Tool |
|--------|------|
| Korea | LTV cap, FX derivative limits |
| China | LTV + DTI ratios |
| Thailand | Reserve requirements, capital controls |

---

# Institutional Architecture

## Options for Financial Stability Regulation

1. Central bank-led (e.g., Bank of England)

2. Financial stability council (e.g., US FSOC)

3. Hybrid model (e.g., Japan, Korea)

> **Key requirement**: coordination across agencies

---

# Regional Cooperation

- Volatile capital flows call for cross-border dialogue

- **Asian Financial Stability Dialogue (AFSD)** proposed
- Potential roles:
  - Risk surveillance
  - Coordinated responses
  - Sharing resolution frameworks

---

# Financial Stability and Climate Change

- Climate change poses **physical**, **transition** and **liquidity risks** to the financial system

- Central banks integrate climate into:
  - **Macroprudential stress testing**
  - **Capital requirements** (under consideration)
  - **Capital buffers** (under consideration)
  - Disclosure standards (e.g., TCFD)
  - Supporting green finance and sustainable investment
  - **Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS)**

- Asian central banks (e.g., MAS, BoK, PBoC) increasingly participate in **NGFS**

---

# Financial Stability and New Technologies

- **FinTech**: Innovation in payments, lending, and digital assets
  - Potential for faster services, but increased cyber and operational risk

- **AI/ML**: Enhancing credit assessment, fraud detection, but may amplify biases or risk clustering

- **RegTech**: Automates compliance, improves data transparency

- **SupTech**: Supervisory tech used by regulators to monitor risk in real time

- Challenge: Regulate innovation without stifling it; **sandbox environments** are key

---

# Current Challenges to Financial Stability

- **Geopolitical risks**: Conflicts, trade tensions, and sanctions affecting capital flows

- **High debt levels**: Public and private sector leverage post-COVID

- **Inflation shocks**: Tightening cycles exposing vulnerabilities in debt markets

- **Financial market volatility**: Repricing of risk due to interest rate hikes

- **Shadow banking**: Growth of non-bank financial intermediaries

- **Cybersecurity threats**: Increasing digitalization exposes system to operational risks

- **Climate-related shocks**: More frequent natural disasters and transitional financial risks

---

# Discussion

- Should central banks target asset prices?

- Is “leaning against the wind” always preferable to “cleaning” after?

- What tools are more effective: macroprudential or monetary?

- How can climate and digital finance be incorporated into regulation?

---

# Summary

- Financial stability is essential for long-term macroeconomic health

- Central banks need flexible tools and clear mandates

- Asia’s experience offers valuable lessons for EMEs globally

- New risks from climate and technology must be integrated into frameworks
