# 2. Course Overview

---

# Course Description:

- **Designed for Incoming Students**: Provides basic background knowledge on mathematical methods essential for success in international economics, business, and financial studies.  

- **Core Topics Covered**: Introductory algebra, differentiation, matrix analysis, and optimization—building a strong foundation for analytical decision-making in the global economy.  

- **Applied Focus**: Emphasizes economic and statistical applications rather than mathematical proofs or detailed theorem derivations.  

- **Mathematics is Fun!**: More than just a tool for solving real-world problems, this course makes learning math engaging and enjoyable.

---

# Course Objectives:

*Students will apply the following mathematical concepts to economics, business, and finance:*

- **Graphs of Functions** – Visualizing relationships  

- **Solving Equations** – Linear and nonlinear solutions  

- **Differentiation** – Rates of change and marginal analysis  

- **Optimization** – Comparative statics and partial differentiation  

- **Integration** – Basic concepts  

- **Linear Algebra** – Matrices for economic modeling

---

# Course Learning Outcomes:

By the end of this course, students will be able to:  

- Analyze mathematical functions in economic and business contexts.  

- Solve linear and nonlinear equations for real-world applications.  

- Apply differentiation for optimization and economic analysis.  

- Use comparative statics and partial differentiation in decision-making.  

- Perform basic integration for economic modeling.  

- Apply matrix algebra to solve systems of equations.  

- Develop problem-solving skills using mathematical reasoning.  

- Recognize that mathematics is both useful and fun!

---

# The Course in a Nutshell

- **Mathematical Foundations** – Learn the essential math skills needed for economics.  

- **Hands-On Learning** – Apply concepts through class activities and home assignments.

- In-class lectures and exercises

- Post-class problem sets (each assignment consists of 5-10 short questions)

- TA sessions before quizzes and exams

- For some classes, pre-class online preview (15-30 min. recorded lecture and/or related video materials) will be provided.

---

# Course materials:

- **Lecture notes**

# 3. Personal Challenges

- Health 

- Family

- Job

- Universe against you


**.red[Come talk to me ASAP]**

---

# 4. Math Anxiety / PTSD

- Traumatic math experiences

- Can't operate numbers

- Don't see econ linkages
