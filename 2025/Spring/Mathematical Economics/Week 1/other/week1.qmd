# Course Overview

## Teaching method

- The course consists of lectures, in-class activities (practicums), and demonstrations that emphasize hands-on, practical tasks that give students the chance to put what they have learned to the test and improve their skills. 

- In-class lectures and exercises
- Post-class problem sets (each assignment consists of 5-10 short questions)
- TA sessions before quizzes and exams
- For some classes, pre-class online preview (15-30 min. recorded lecture and/or related video materials) will be provided.

# Course Overview

## Course materials:

- **Lecture notes**

- Jacques, Ian (2023) **Mathematics for Economics and Business**, 10th ed., Pearson. Any previous edition would be also fine.
