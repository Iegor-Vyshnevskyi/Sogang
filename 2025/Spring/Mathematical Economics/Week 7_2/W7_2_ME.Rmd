# 1. The Derivative of the Exponential and Natural Log Functions (4.8)

# Why It Matters: Economics & Finance Perspective

Exponential and logarithmic functions are foundational in economics and finance:

- They model **continuous growth and decay** â€“ essential for understanding investment returns, population growth, inflation, and depreciation.
- The exponential function captures **compound interest**, while logarithms are key for solving equations involving **growth rates**.
- Derivatives of these functions help economists and analysts assess **rates of change** â€“ such as marginal returns, discounting future values, or analyzing production over time.

Understanding how to **differentiate** exponential and logarithmic functions equips you with tools to interpret trends, optimize financial decisions, and make precise economic forecasts.

---

# Learning Objectives

## Section 4.8 â€“ Derivatives of Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

- Differentiate the **exponential function**
- Differentiate the **natural logarithm function**
- Use **chain, product and quotient rules** with these functions
- Apply exponential models to **real-world economic problems**

---

# Basic Rules of Differentiation (Exponential & Logarithmic Functions)

### Exponential Function:
The exponential function grows **proportionally to its value**.

$$
\frac{d}{dx}e^x = e^x
$$
This is unique: the derivative of $e^x$ is itself!

### Natural Logarithm:
Logarithms are used to reverse exponential growth.

$$
\frac{d}{dx}\ln(x) = \frac{1}{x}, \quad x > 0
$$

---

# Basic Rules of Differentiation (Exponential & Logarithmic Functions) (cont'd)

### Chain Rule:
Use when differentiating **functions within functions**.

- $$ \frac{d}{dx} e^{f(x)} = f'(x) \cdot e^{f(x)} $$
- $$ \frac{d}{dx} \ln(f(x)) = \frac{f'(x)}{f(x)} $$

These rules are essential in **economic models** involving growth, decay, and elasticity.

# Examples: Basic Differentiation

### 1. Differentiate:
$$ f(x) = e^{3x} $$
**Solution:**
$$ f'(x) = 3e^{3x} $$
- Use chain rule: derivative of exponent times original exponential

### 2. Differentiate:
$$ g(x) = \ln(5x^2 + 1) $$
**Solution:**
$$ g'(x) = \frac{10x}{5x^2 + 1} $$
- Chain rule: differentiate inside function $5x^2 + 1$ â†’ $10x$

**Tip:** Exponentials often model compounded growth, and logs appear in utility, elasticity, and returns.

---

# Product & Quotient Rule in Action

## Example 1: Product Rule
$$ y = x^2 e^x $$
Apply:
$$ \frac{d}{dx}(uv) = u'v + uv' $$

- $u = x^2$, $v = e^x$
- Derivative: $$ \frac{dy}{dx} = 2x e^x + x^2 e^x = e^x(2x + x^2) $$

Use when both parts involve variables (common in cost/revenue products).

---
# Product & Quotient Rule in Action (cont'd)

## Example 2: Quotient Rule
$$ y = \frac{\ln(x)}{x^2} $$
Apply:
$$ \frac{d}{dx} \left(\frac{u}{v}\right) = \frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2} $$

- $u = \ln(x)$, $v = x^2$
- Derivative:
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1/x \cdot x^2 - \ln(x) \cdot 2x}{x^4} = \frac{x - 2x\ln(x)}{x^4}
$$

Use when differentiating ratios like **marginal utility/cost per unit**.

---

# Application: Continuous Revenue Growth

Let the revenue function be:
$$ R(t) = 5000e^{0.05t} $$
This implies revenue grows **at a continuous rate of 5%** per time unit.

### Find the rate of change of revenue:
$$
R'(t) = 5000 \cdot 0.05e^{0.05t} = 250e^{0.05t}
$$

Interpretation:
- The **growth rate is proportional** to the current revenue.
- Common in modeling investment returns, inflation, or GDP.

---

# Application: Elasticity of Growth

A common growth model:
$$ Q(t) = Ae^{rt} $$
Where:
- $Q(t)$ is output (e.g., capital, population)
- $A$ is initial value
- $r$ is the growth rate

---

# Application: Elasticity of Growth (cont'd)

### Find:
- $$ \frac{dQ}{dt} = rAe^{rt} = rQ(t) $$
- Elasticity of growth:
$$ E = \frac{dQ/dt}{Q} = r $$

**Interpretation:** Elasticity is **constant** in exponential growth â†’ % change in $Q$ for 1% change in time.

Used in modeling:
- Population growth
- Compound interest
- Inflation and real returns

---


# Summary

- Exponential and log functions are common in **growth, interest, decay** models
- Chain rule is crucial when inside other functions
- Product and quotient rules still apply!

> Exponentials capture **compounding**; logs help **linearize** growth patterns.

# Practice Problems

1. Differentiate:
   - (a) $f(x) = e^{2x^2}$
   - (b) $g(x) = \ln(x^2 + 1)$

2. Use product rule:
   - (a) $y = x e^{3x}$

3. Use quotient rule:
   - (a) $y = \frac{e^x}{x^3}$

4. Application:
   - Revenue grows as $R(t) = 12000e^{0.04t}$. Find $R'(t)$ and interpret.

# âœ… Solutions: Practice Problems


## ðŸ”¹ 1. Differentiate:

### (a) $f(x) = e^{2x^2}$

Use chain rule:

$$
f'(x) = e^{2x^2} \cdot \frac{d}{dx}(2x^2) = e^{2x^2} \cdot 4x = 4x e^{2x^2}
$$



### (b) $g(x) = \ln(x^2 + 1)$

Use chain rule:

$$
g'(x) = \frac{1}{x^2 + 1} \cdot 2x = \frac{2x}{x^2 + 1}
$$



## ðŸ”¹ 2. Product Rule

### (a) $y = x e^{3x}$

Let $u = x$, $v = e^{3x}$

$$
y' = u'v + uv' = 1 \cdot e^{3x} + x \cdot 3e^{3x} = e^{3x} + 3x e^{3x}
$$

âœ… Final Answer: $y' = e^{3x}(1 + 3x)$



## ðŸ”¹ 3. Quotient Rule

### (a) $y = \frac{e^x}{x^3}$

Let $u = e^x$, $v = x^3$

$$
y' = \frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2} = \frac{e^x \cdot x^3 - e^x \cdot 3x^2}{x^6}
= \frac{e^x (x^3 - 3x^2)}{x^6}
= \frac{e^x x^2 (x - 3)}{x^6} = \frac{e^x(x - 3)}{x^4}
$$

âœ… Final Answer: $y' = \frac{e^x(x - 3)}{x^4}$



## ðŸ”¹ 4. Application: Revenue Growth

### Given: $R(t) = 12000e^{0.04t}$

$$
R'(t) = 12000 \cdot 0.04 \cdot e^{0.04t} = 480 e^{0.04t}
$$

### âœ… Interpretation:

The **rate of change of revenue** is proportional to the current revenue level.  
This reflects **exponential growth** â€“ each year, revenue grows faster.
