# Why It Matters in Economics & Finance

- **Resource Allocation:** Optimal use of limited resources

- **Cost Minimization:** Firms aim to minimize costs given production constraints

- **Utility Maximization:** Consumers maximize utility given budget constraints

---

# Learning Objectives

- Apply the Lagrange multiplier method to solve constrained optimization problems.

- Interpret the economic meaning of the Lagrange multiplier as the marginal value of the constraint.

- Solve optimization problems involving Cobb-Douglas production functions with cost constraints.

- Demonstrate that at the optimal point, the ratio of marginal product to price is equal for all inputs.

---

# What Are Lagrange Multipliers?

- Lagrange multipliers provide a way to find the **maximum or minimum** of a function subject to a constraint.
- They are particularly useful in economics for problems involving **cost minimization** or **utility maximization**.
- The method involves introducing a new variable (the Lagrange multiplier) to incorporate the constraint into the optimization problem.

- For a function $f(x, y)$ subject to a constraint $g(x, y) = c$, we define the Lagrangian as:

$$
\mathcal{L}(x, y, \lambda) = f(x, y) + \lambda \cdot (c - g(x, y))
$$

- The Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ can be interpreted as the **rate of change of the objective function** with respect to the constraint.

---

# Lagrange Multipliers - Example

### Problem Statement

- Optimize the objective function:
  $$ f(x, y) = x^2 - 3xy + 12x $$

- Subject to the constraint:
  $$ 2x + 3y = 6 $$

---

# Step 1: Define the Lagrangian

- The Lagrangian function is given by:

$$
g(x, y, \lambda) = x^2 - 3xy + 12x + \lambda (6 - 2x - 3y)
$$

---

# Step 2: Derive First-Order Conditions

- Compute the partial derivatives of $g$:

$$
\frac{\partial g}{\partial x} = 2x - 3y + 12 - 2\lambda
$$

$$
\frac{\partial g}{\partial y} = -3x - 3\lambda
$$

$$
\frac{\partial g}{\partial \lambda} = 6 - 2x - 3y
$$

Set each of these derivatives to zero to form the system of equations.

---

# Step 3: Form the System of Equations

1. $2x - 3y - 2\lambda = -12$

2. $-3x - 3\lambda = 0$

3. $2x + 3y = 6$

---

# Step 4: Eliminate Variables

- Multiply (1) by 3 and (2) by 2, then add:

$$
-9y - 12\lambda = -36
$$

$$
-6y - 2\lambda = -18
$$

- Eliminate $y$:

Multiply (4) by 6 and (5) by 9, then subtract:

$$
-54\lambda = -54 \implies \lambda = 1
$$

---

# Step 5: Substitute to Find $y$ and $x$

- Substitute $\lambda = 1$ in (5):

$$
-6y - 2(1) = -18
$$

$$
-6y = -16 \implies y = \frac{8}{3}
$$

- Substitute $y = \frac{8}{3}$ and $\lambda = 1$ in (1):

$$
2x - 3\left(\frac{8}{3}\right) - 2(1) = -12
$$

$$
2x - 8 - 2 = -12 \implies x = -1
$$

---

# Step 6: Calculate Optimal Value

- Optimal solution:
  - $x = -1$, $y = \frac{8}{3}$, $\lambda = 1$

- Calculate the objective function at the optimal point:

$$
f(-1, \frac{8}{3}) = (-1)^2 - 3(-1)\left(\frac{8}{3}\right) + 12(-1)
$$

$$
= 1 + 8 - 12 = -3
$$

- Optimal value of the objective function: **-3**

---

# Step 7: Economic Interpretation

- The Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ represents the **marginal value of the constraint**.

- In this case, it indicates how much the objective function would change if the constraint were relaxed by one unit.

- A positive $\lambda$ suggests that the constraint is binding, meaning that the optimal solution is constrained by the budget.

- A negative $\lambda$ indicates that the constraint is not binding, and the optimal solution is not affected by the constraint.

- The optimal solution $(x, y)$ represents the best allocation of resources given the constraint.

- The Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ provides insight into the trade-offs involved in the optimization problem, helping to understand the sensitivity of the objective function to changes in the constraint.

- In this case, the optimal solution suggests that the firm should allocate resources in a way that maximizes the objective function while adhering to the constraint.

# Lagrange Multipliers: Profit Maximization

A monopolistic producer of two goods $G_1$ and $G_2$ has the following cost function:

$$
TC = 10Q_1 + Q_1Q_2 + 10Q_2
$$

Demand equations:

$$
P_1 = 50 - Q_1 + Q_2 $$ 

$$ P_2 = 30 + 2Q_1 - Q_2
$$

Objective: Maximize profit given the constraint that the total output is 15 units.

---

# Step 1: Formulate the Lagrangian

Objective function (Profit):

$$
\pi = TR - TC
$$

Total Revenue:

$$
TR_1 = (50 - Q_1 + Q_2)Q_1 = 50Q_1 - Q_1^2 + Q_1Q_2
$$

$$
TR_2 = (30 + 2Q_1 - Q_2)Q_2 = 30Q_2 + 2Q_1Q_2 - Q_2^2
$$

Total Revenue:

$$
TR = 50Q_1 - Q_1^2 + 3Q_1Q_2 + 30Q_2 - Q_2^2
$$

Profit function:

$$
\pi = 50Q_1 - Q_1^2 + 3Q_1Q_2 + 30Q_2 - Q_2^2 - (10Q_1 + Q_1Q_2 + 10Q_2)
$$

Simplify:

$$
\pi = 40Q_1 - Q_1^2 + 2Q_1Q_2 + 20Q_2 - Q_2^2
$$

Constraint:

$$
Q_1 + Q_2 = 15
$$

Lagrangian:

$$
L(Q_1, Q_2, \lambda) = 40Q_1 - Q_1^2 + 2Q_1Q_2 + 20Q_2 - Q_2^2 + \lambda (15 - Q_1 - Q_2)
$$

---

# Step 2: First-Order Conditions

1. Derivative with respect to $Q_1$:

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial Q_1} = 40 - 2Q_1 + 2Q_2 - \lambda = 0
$$

2. Derivative with respect to $Q_2$:

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial Q_2} = 20 + 2Q_1 - 2Q_2 - \lambda = 0
$$

3. Derivative with respect to $\lambda$:

$$
15 - Q_1 - Q_2 = 0
$$

---

# Step 3: Solving the System

Rewriting the equations:

1. $40 - 2Q_1 + 2Q_2 - \lambda = 0$

2. $20 + 2Q_1 - 2Q_2 - \lambda = 0$

3. $Q_1 + Q_2 = 15$

Adding the first two equations to eliminate $\lambda$:

$$
60 - 4Q_1 = 0 \implies Q_1 = 10
$$

Substituting in the constraint:

$$
10 + Q_2 = 15 \implies Q_2 = 5
$$

Optimal output levels: $Q_1 = 10$, $Q_2 = 5$

---

# Step 4: Profit Calculation

Substitute $Q_1 = 10$, $Q_2 = 5$ in the profit function:

$$
\pi = 40(10) - (10)^2 + 2(10)(5) + 20(5) - (5)^2
$$

$$
\pi = 400 - 100 + 100 + 100 - 25 = 475
$$

---

# Economic Interpretation

- The optimal profit is **475 units**.

- The Lagrange multiplier $\lambda = 30$ represents the **marginal increase in profit** for each additional unit of the constraint (production quota).

- If the quota increases by 1 unit, profit increases by approximately 30 units.

# Practice Problem 1: Maximizing $ 2x^2 - xy $


Use Lagrange multipliers to optimise
$$
2x^2 - xy $$

subject to
$$
x + y = 12
$$

Give economic interpretation of the solution.

???

### Objective:
Maximize:
$$ g(x, y, \lambda) = 2x^2 - xy + \lambda (12 - x - y) $$

1. **First-order conditions:**
- $ g_x = 4x - y - \lambda = 0 $
- $ g_y = -x - \lambda = 0 $
- $ g_\lambda = 12 - x - y = 0 $

**Step-by-step solution:**
- From the second equation: $ -x - \lambda = 0 $ → $ \lambda = -x $
- Substitute $ \lambda = -x $ into the first equation:
  $$ 4x - y - (-x) = 0 \implies 5x - y = 0 \implies y = 5x $$
- Substitute $ y = 5x $ in the third equation:
  $$ 12 - x - 5x = 0 \implies 6x = 12 \implies x = 2 $$
- Thus, $ y = 5(2) = 10 $

**Solution:**
- Optimal values: $ x = 2, y = 10 $
- Substitute in the objective function:
  $$ g = 2(2)^2 - (2)(10) = 8 - 20 = -12 $$
- Interpretation: The optimal output is -12 units.

# Practice Problem 2: Utility Maximization

A consumer’s utility function is given by
$$
U(x_1, x_2) = 2x_1 x_2 + 3x_1$$

where $x_1$ and $x_2$ denote the number of items of two goods $G_1$ and $G_2$ that are bought. 
Each item costs $1 for $G_1$ and $2 for $G_2$. 
Use Lagrange multipliers to find the maximum value of $U$ if the consumer’s income is $83. 
Estimate the new optimal utility if the consumer’s income rises by $1.



???

### Objective:
Maximize:
$$ g(x_1, x_2, \lambda) = 2x_1 x_2 + 3x_1 + \lambda (83 - x_1 - 2x_2) $$

1. **First-order conditions:**
- $ g_{x_1} = 2x_2 + 3 - \lambda = 0 $
- $ g_{x_2} = 2x_1 - 2\lambda = 0 $
- $ g_\lambda = 83 - x_1 - 2x_2 = 0 $

**Step-by-step solution:**
- From the first equation: $ \lambda = 2x_2 + 3 $
- Substitute $ \lambda = 2x_2 + 3 $ in the second equation:
  $$ 2x_1 - 2(2x_2 + 3) = 0 \implies 2x_1 - 4x_2 - 6 = 0 \implies x_1 = 2x_2 + 3 $$
- Substitute $ x_1 = 2x_2 + 3 $ in the third equation:
  $$ 83 - (2x_2 + 3) - 2x_2 = 0 \implies 83 - 3x_2 - 3 = 0 \implies 80 = 3x_2 \implies x_2 \approx 26.67 $$
- Thus, $ x_1 = 2(26.67) + 3 \approx 56.34 $

**Solution:**
- Optimal values: $ x_1 \approx 56.34, x_2 \approx 26.67 $
- Interpretation: The optimal utility is achieved when the consumer allocates approximately 56.34 units to G1 and 26.67 units to G2.
- If income increases by $1, the Lagrange multiplier indicates the marginal utility gain.
