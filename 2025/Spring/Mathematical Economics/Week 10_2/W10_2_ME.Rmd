# Why It Matters in Economics & Business

- Optimization helps firms maximize profit by adjusting inputs or pricing.

- It allows for strategic decision-making in pricing, production, and resource allocation.

- Applications in:
  - Cost minimization (minimizing production costs)
  - Profit maximization (maximizing revenue)
  - Price discrimination (optimizing prices in different markets)
  - Resource allocation (optimizing the use of limited resources)
  - Risk management (optimizing investment portfolios)

---

# Learning Objectives

By the end of this class, you should be able to:

- Use first-order partial derivatives to find stationary points.

- Use second-order partial derivatives to classify stationary points.

- Maximize the profit of a firm producing two goods.

- Optimize profit for a firm using price discrimination in different markets.

# Finding Stationary Points

- Our first step is to find the stationary points of a function.
  - A stationary point is where the first derivative (or partial derivative) is zero.
- Why? - Because it indicates a potential maximum or minimum.
- We can find stationary points using the first-order conditions.

For a function of two variables $f(x, y)$, the first-order partial derivatives are:

$$
f_x = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \quad f_y = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}
$$

Stationary points occur where both derivatives equal zero:

$$
f_x = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad f_y = 0
$$

**Example:**  
Let $f(x, y) = 3x^2 - 2xy + y^2$  
1. Calculate $f_x$ and $f_y$.  
2. Set $f_x = 0$ and $f_y = 0$ to find the stationary points.

---

# Solution: Stationary Points

1. First-order derivatives:

$$
f_x = 6x - 2y, \quad f_y = -2x + 2y
$$

Setting them to zero:

$$
6x - 2y = 0 \
-2x + 2y = 0
$$

Solving simultaneously:

- $y = 3x$  
- Substitute $y = 3x$ in the first equation:  
  $6x - 6x = 0$  

Stationary point: $(x, y) = (0, 0)$.

It means that at this point, the slope of the function is zero in both directions.
- This is a candidate for a local maximum, minimum, or saddle point.

# Second-Order Partial Derivatives and Hessian Matrix

To classify the stationary points, we use the second-order partial derivatives:

$f_{xx}, f_{yy}, f_{xy}$

The determinant of the Hessian matrix $D$ is given by:

$D = f_{xx} \cdot f_{yy} - (f_{xy})^2$

- If $D > 0$ and $f_{xx} > 0$: Local Min  
- If $D > 0$ and $f_{xx} < 0$: Local Max  
- If $D < 0$: Saddle Point  
- If $D = 0$: Inconclusive  

Note 1: The second-order conditions are necessary but not sufficient for a maximum or minimum.
- They help us classify the nature of the stationary point.
- If $D = 0$, we cannot conclude anything about the nature of the stationary point.
- We may need to use higher-order derivatives or other methods to classify the point.

Note 2: The second-order conditions are based on the assumption that the function is twice differentiable.
- If the function is not twice differentiable, we may need to use other methods to classify the point.

# Second-Order Partial Derivatives and Hessian Matrix (cont'd)

## Hessian Matrix

### What is the Hessian Matrix?

- The Hessian matrix, denoted by $H_x$, is a square matrix of second-order partial derivatives of a scalar-valued function $f(x_1, x_2)$.
- It provides information about the **curvature** of the function and helps in determining the nature of stationary points.
- The determinant of the Hessian matrix is used to classify stationary points.

### Definition:

$$
H_x = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_1^2} & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2} \\
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2} & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_2^2}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Explanation:
- **Diagonal Elements:** Measure the curvature with respect to each variable independently.
- **Off-Diagonal Elements:** Measure how the function curvature changes when both variables interact.

# Second-Order Partial Derivatives and Hessian Matrix (cont'd)

## Hessian Matrix


### Why is it Important?
- The Hessian matrix helps to determine the nature of stationary points:
  
  - Positive determinant and positive diagonal elements: **Local minimum**.
  
  - Positive determinant and negative diagonal elements: **Local maximum**.
  
  - Negative determinant: **Saddle point**.
  
  - Zero determinant: **Inconclusive test**.


---

# Example: Classification

Continuing from the previous example:

Second-order derivatives:

$f_{xx} = 6, \quad f_{yy} = 2, \quad f_{xy} = -2$

Determinant:

$$
D = (6)(2) - (-2)^2 = 12 - 4 = 8
$$

Since $D > 0$ and $f_{xx} > 0$, the point $(0, 0)$ is a **local minimum**.
It means that the function has a minimum value at this point.
- The function is concave (curves inward like the interior of a circle or sphere) up in both directions at this point.
- The function is increasing in both directions away from this point.
- The function is "bowl-shaped" at this point.
- The function has a unique minimum value at this point.

# Visualizing the Function

.center[<img src="p2.png" height="30%" width="30%">]

- The blue regions indicate lower values of z, while the red regions indicate higher values.
- The shape is not symmetric due to the interaction term -2xy, creating a slanted surface.
- The plot has a ridge or saddle point where the slope changes direction, indicating points of inflection or mixed concavity.

# Economic Application (1): Profit Maximization

A firm produces two goods $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ with profit function:

$\Pi(Q_1, Q_2) = 200Q_1 + 300Q_2 - 50Q_1^2 - 75Q_2^2 - 30Q_1Q_2$

1. Determine the profit-maximizing quantities.

2. Classify the stationary points using the second-order derivatives.

---

# Solution: Profit Maximization

1. First-order derivatives:

$$
\Pi_{Q_1} = 200 - 100Q_1 - 30Q_2
$$

$$
\Pi_{Q_2} = 300 - 150Q_2 - 30Q_1
$$

Setting to zero:

$$
200 - 100Q_1 - 30Q_2 = 0 \
300 - 150Q_2 - 30Q_1 = 0
$$

Solving simultaneously:
- $Q_1 = 1$  
- $Q_2 = 1$

---
# Solution: Profit Maximization (cont'd)

2. Second-order derivatives:

$\Pi_{Q_1Q_1} = -100, \quad \Pi_{Q_2Q_2} = -150, \quad \Pi_{Q_1Q_2} = -30$

Hessian Determinant:

$$
D = (-100)(-150) - (-30)^2 = 15000 - 900 = 14100
$$

Since $D > 0$ and $\Pi_{Q_1Q_1} < 0$, the point $(1, 1)$ is a **local maximum**.

It means that the firm maximizes its profit at this point.

---

# Your turn: Profit Maximization

A firm produces two goods $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ with the following profit function:

$$  
\Pi(Q_1, Q_2) = 150Q_1 + 250Q_2 - 40Q_1^2 - 60Q_2^2 - 20Q_1Q_2
$$

### Tasks:
1. **Determine the profit-maximizing quantities.**  
2. **Classify the stationary points** using the second-order derivatives.  
3. **Interpret the economic meaning** of the results.

???

# **Solution: First-Order Derivatives**

1. First-order derivatives:

$$  
\Pi_{Q_1} = 150 - 80Q_1 - 20Q_2  
\Pi_{Q_2} = 250 - 120Q_2 - 20Q_1  
$$

Setting both derivatives to zero:

$$  
150 - 80Q_1 - 20Q_2 = 0  
250 - 120Q_2 - 20Q_1 = 0  
$$

Solving simultaneously:
- $Q_1 = 1.5$  
- $Q_2 = 1.5$


# **Solution: Second-Order Derivatives**

2. Second-order derivatives:

$$  
\Pi_{Q_1Q_1} = -80, \quad \Pi_{Q_2Q_2} = -120, \quad \Pi_{Q_1Q_2} = -20
$$

Hessian Determinant:

$$  
D = (-80)(-120) - (-20)^2 = 9600 - 400 = 9200
$$

- Since $D > 0$ and $\Pi_{Q_1Q_1} < 0$, the point $(1.5, 1.5)$ is a **local maximum**.



# **Economic Interpretation**
- The firm maximizes its profit by producing **1.5 units of each good**.
- The positive determinant of the Hessian matrix indicates a local maximum.
- The negative values of the second derivatives indicate that the function is concave down, confirming a maximum.

---

# Your turn: Cost Minimization

A firm produces two goods using two inputs, labor (L) and capital (K), with the following cost function:

$$
C = 40L + 30K
$$

The production function is given by:

$$
Q = L^{0.5}K^{0.5}
$$

1. **Determine the optimal input combination** to minimize costs given that the firm must produce 100 units of output.

2. **Verify the optimal solution** using the second-order conditions.

3. **Interpret the economic meaning** of the results.


???

# âœ… Solution: Cost Minimization

1. **Constraint:**

To produce 100 units:

$$
Q = L^{0.5}K^{0.5} = 100 \
L^{0.5}K^{0.5} = 100 \
L^{0.5}K^{0.5} = 100 \
L^{0.5} = \frac{100}{K^{0.5}}
$$

Square both sides:

$$
L = \frac{100^2}{K}
$$

???

# âœ… Solution: Cost Minimization (cont'd)

2. **Cost Function:**

Substitute \( L = \frac{100^2}{K} \) into the cost function:

$$
C = 40L + 30K \
C = 40\left( \frac{100^2}{K} \right) + 30K \
C = \frac{400000}{K} + 30K
$$

Take the first derivative and set to zero:

$$
\frac{dC}{dK} = -\frac{400000}{K^2} + 30 = 0
$$

Solve for \( K \):

$$
30K^2 = 400000 \
K^2 = \frac{400000}{30} \
K = \sqrt{\frac{400000}{30}} \approx 115.47
$$

Now, find \( L \):

$$
L = \frac{100^2}{115.47} \approx 86.61
$$

???

# âœ… Verification: Second-Order Condition

1. Second derivatives:

$$
\frac{d^2C}{dK^2} = \frac{800000}{K^3}
$$

Since \( \frac{d^2C}{dK^2} > 0 \), the function is **convex**, confirming a minimum point.

The optimal input combination to minimize costs while producing 100 units is **L = 86.61, K = 115.47**.

# Economic Interpretation
- The firm seeks to **minimize costs** while producing a fixed level of output (100 units).
- The optimal combination of inputs is **L = 86.61, K = 115.47**.
- The higher allocation to capital (K) indicates that capital is relatively less expensive per unit than labor.
- This result can guide the firm in allocating resources effectively, optimizing cost structure, and making strategic production decisions.
