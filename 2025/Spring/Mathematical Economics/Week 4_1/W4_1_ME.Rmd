# Introduction

**Mathematics of Finance** is crucial for **investment decisions** and **economic analysis**.

- **Why do we study these?**
  - **Percentages** are used in **finance, economics, and business**.

  - **Compound interest** is crucial for **investment decisions**.

  - **Inflation rates** and **population growth** are expressed in percentages.

# Percentages

---

# **Section 3.1: Percentages**

### **What is a Percentage?**
- A **percentage** is a fraction out of 100.

- Expressed as:
  $$ \text{Percentage} = \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \times 100 $$

### **Example:**
If a product costs $200 and increases to $240:

$$
\text{Percentage Increase} = \frac{240 - 200}{200} \times 100 = 20\%
$$

---

## **Percentage Increase and Decrease**

- **Increase**: Multiply by $1 + \frac{r}{100}$

- **Decrease**: Multiply by $1 - \frac{r}{100}$

### **Example:**
Price increases by 15%:
$$
\text{New Price} = 100 \times (1 + 0.15) = 115
$$

---

## **Bps and Percentage Points**

- **Basis points (bps)** are used to express **small percentage changes**.

- **Percentage points** are used to express **absolute changes**.

### **Example:**

- If the interest rate increases from 5% to 6%:
  - This is a **1% increase** or **100 bps increase**.

- If the interest rate increases from 5% to 7%:
  - This is a **2% increase** or **200 bps increase**.

---

## **Scale Factors**

- A **scale factor** expresses the effect of a percentage change.

- For example, a 20% increase corresponds to a scale factor of 1.20.

### **Example:**

- If a price decrease by 10%:
  - The scale factor is 0.90.

- If a price increases by 25%:
  - The scale factor is 1.25.

---

## **Overall Percentage Changes**

To find total percentage change over multiple steps:
$$
\text{Overall Scale Factor} = (1 + r_1)(1 + r_2) \cdots (1 + r_n)
$$

### **Example:**
Increase by 10%, then decrease by 5%:
$$
1.10 \times 0.95 = 1.045 \Rightarrow 4.5\% \text{ total increase}
$$

---

## **Index Numbers**

- Index numbers show how a value changes relative to a base period.

$$
\text{Index} = \frac{\text{Current Value}}{\text{Base Value}} \times 100
$$

### **Example:**
CPI increases from 100 to 108:
- This indicates an **8% increase in prices**.

- Calculated as:
  $$
  \text{CPI} = \frac{108}{100} \times 100 = 108
  $$

---

## **Adjusting for Inflation**

To find real value:
$$
\text{Real Value} = \frac{\text{Nominal Value}}{\text{Price Index}} \times 100
$$

PS: **CPI** is used as a **price index**. Real value is a value adjusted for inflation. Nominal value is the original value.

### **Example:**
Nominal wage = $500, CPI = 125:
$$
\text{Real Wage} = \frac{500}{125} \times 100 = 400
$$

# Calculating Index Numbers: Table 3.1 Example

## **Household Spending (in billions of dollars)**

| Year       | Y1    | Y2    | Y3    | Y4    | Y5    |
|------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Spending   | 686.9 | 697.2 | 723.7 | 716.6 | 734.5 |

- Table 3.1 shows the values of household spending (in billions of dollars) during a five year period. 

- Calculate the index numbers when Year 2 is taken as the base year and give a brief interpretation.

---

## Step-by-Step: Base Year = Y2 (697.2)

- **Formula**:  
  $$
  \text{Index Number} = \left( \frac{\text{Value in Year X}}{\text{Value in Base Year}} \right) \times 100
  $$

- **Y2** (Base Year):  
  $$
  \text{Index} = \left( \frac{697.2}{697.2} \right) \times 100 = 100
  $$

- **Y3**:  
  $$
  \text{Index} = \left( \frac{723.7}{697.2} \right) \times 100 \approx 103.8
  $$

- **Interpretation**:  
  Spending in **Y3** was **103.8%** of that in Y2 ‚Üí increase of **3.8%**

---

## Continuing with Y4 and Y5

- **Y4**:  
  $$
  \text{Index} = \left( \frac{716.6}{697.2} \right) \times 100 \approx 102.8
  $$

  ‚Üí Spending rose only **2.8%** from Y2, lower than Y3.

- **Y5**:  
  $$
  \text{Index} = \left( \frac{734.5}{697.2} \right) \times 100 \approx 105.4
  $$

- **Y1**:
  $$
  \text{Index} = \left( \frac{686.9}{697.2} \right) \times 100 \approx 98.5
  $$

- **Interpretation**:  
  Spending in **Y5** was **5.4%** higher than in Y2.

---

## Final Index Table (Base Year = Y2)

| Year | Y1    | Y2  | Y3   | Y4   | Y5   |
|------|-------|-----|------|------|------|
| Index| 98.5  | 100 | 103.8| 102.8| 105.4 |

---

## Why Use Index Numbers?

- Simplifies comparison across time periods

- Common in **price indices**, **GDP**, **inflation tracking**

- Allows interpretation like:  
  ‚ÄúSpending in Y5 is **5.4% higher** than in Y2‚Äù

# Compound Interest

---

# **Section 3.2: Compound Interest**

### **Simple vs Compound Interest**

- **Simple Interest**: Earned only on the principal.

- **Compound Interest**: Earned on **principal and accumulated interest**.

### **Example:**

- $1000 invested at 5% for 3 years:
  - **Simple Interest**: $1000 + $150 = $1150
  - **Compound Interest**: $1157.63

- Because:
  - $1000 + $1000(0.05)*3 = 1150$
  - $1000(1 + 0.05)^3 = 1157.63$ 


---

## **Annual Compounding Formula**

- **Annual Compounding** stands for interest *calculated once a year*.

$$
A = P(1 + r)^t
$$
where:
- $A$: final amount
- $P$: principal
- $r$: interest rate per year
- $t$: time in years

### **Example:**
$P = 1000$, $r = 5\%$, $t = 3$:
$$
A = 1000(1 + 0.05)^3 = 1157.63
$$

---

## **Continuous Compounding Formula**

- **Continuous Compounding** means that there is *no limit* to how often interest can compound.

$$
A = Pe^{rt}
$$

### **Example:**
$P = 1000$, $r = 0.05$, $t = 3$:
$$
A = 1000e^{0.15} \approx 1161.83
$$

---

# Constant Growth Rate Over Time

## **Example: Output Growth Over 5 Years**

A firm wants to increase output from **50,000** to **60,000** over **5 years** at a **constant annual rate**.

We are solving for the **growth rate $ r \% $**.

---

## Step-by-Step Solution

Let the scale factor be:

$$
(1 + \frac{r}{100})^5
$$

To reach 60,000 in 5 years:

$$
50,000 \cdot \left(1 + \frac{r}{100}\right)^5 = 60,000
$$

Divide both sides by 50,000:

$$
\left(1 + \frac{r}{100}\right)^5 = 1.2
$$

---

## Taking the Fifth Root

Solve:

$$
1 + \frac{r}{100} = (1.2)^{1/5}
$$

Compute:

$$
1 + \frac{r}{100} \approx 1.0371
$$

Subtract 1:

$$
\frac{r}{100} \approx 0.0371 \Rightarrow r \approx 3.71\%
$$

**Conclusion**: The firm needs a constant **annual growth rate of approximately 3.7%** to reach 60,000 in 5 years.

---

## Why This Matters in Economics?

- Helps forecast growth of **output**, **investment**, **GDP**, or **population**.

- Realistic use of **compound growth**, especially in planning or project evaluation.

---


## **Effective Annual Rate (EAR)**

- **EAR** is the **true return on investment**. It accounts for compounding.

If interest is compounded more than once a year:
$$
\text{EAR} = \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^n - 1
$$
where $n$ = number of compounding periods per year

### **Example:**
Nominal rate 6% compounded quarterly:
$$
\text{EAR} = \left(1 + \frac{0.06}{4}\right)^4 - 1 \approx 0.0614 = 6.14\%
$$

It means that the effective annual rate is 6.14%.

???


# üìä Percentages: Real-World Calculations

### 1. A product's price increases from \$80 to \$92:
\[
\frac{92 - 80}{80} \times 100 = \frac{12}{80} \times 100 = 15\%
\]

### 2. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rises from 120 to 132:
\[
\frac{132 - 120}{120} \times 100 = \frac{12}{120} \times 100 = 10\%
\]

### 3. A product's price falls from \$100 to \$80:
\[
\frac{100 - 80}{100} \times 100 = 20\%
\]

### 4. GDP increases from \$500 billion to \$550 billion:
\[
\frac{550 - 500}{500} \times 100 = 10\%
\]



# üí∞ Compound Interest: Growth Over Time

### 5. Calculate compound amount on \$2000 at 6% for 5 years (annual compounding):
\[
A = 2000(1 + 0.06)^5 = 2000(1.3382256) = \boxed{2676.45}
\]

### 6. Compare annual vs. continuous compounding:

- **Annual**: \$2676.45  
- **Continuous**:
\[
A = 2000 \cdot e^{0.3} \approx 2000 \cdot 1.34986 = \boxed{2699.72}
\]

**Difference**: \$2699.72 ‚àí \$2676.45 = \$23.27 (continuous earns more)



# üìà EAR: Effective Annual Rate Comparisons

### 7. 8% Nominal Rate, Compounded Monthly:
\[
\text{EAR} = \left(1 + \frac{0.08}{12}\right)^{12} - 1 \approx \boxed{8.30\%}
\]

### 8. 5% Nominal Rate, Compounded Daily:
\[
\text{EAR} = \left(1 + \frac{0.05}{365}\right)^{365} - 1 \approx \boxed{5.13\%}
\]

### 9. 4% Nominal Rate, Compounded Quarterly:
\[
\text{EAR} = \left(1 + \frac{0.04}{4}\right)^4 - 1 = (1.01)^4 - 1 = \boxed{4.06\%}
\]



---

# **Summary**

- Percentage changes and index numbers help interpret price and value shifts.

- Compound interest is central to banking and investment decisions.

- EAR reveals the true return on investment.
