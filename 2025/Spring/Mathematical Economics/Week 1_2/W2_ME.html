# 1. Real-World Example of Algebra in International Finance

# Example: International Loan Risk

**Scenario:** A company in Europe borrows **$1 million** from a U.S. bank.  

**Problem:** The company earns revenue in euros (â‚¬), but the loan is in dollars ($). 

**Key Question:** How does exchange rate fluctuation impact the companyâ€™s debt?  

**Solution:** Use algebra to analyze the exchange rate risk, loan repayment and other questions.

???

Scenario: Currency Exchange &amp; Loan Risk Management
Imagine you are working for an international bank that provides loans to businesses operating across multiple countries. Your task is to assess the financial risk of a European company that wants to borrow `\(1 million for expansion. Since they earn revenue in euros (â‚¬) but the loan is in U.S. dollars (\)`), you need to evaluate the exchange rate risk and ensure the company can repay the loan.

To analyze the situation, you'll use several key mathematical concepts:


---

# Step 1: Working with Negative Numbers

## **Currency Depreciation &amp; Loan Impact**  

- The exchange rate was **â‚¬1 = $1.10** but dropped to **â‚¬1 = $1.05** 

- This means the **euro lost value**, making it **more expensive** for the company to repay the loan.  

## Using Negative Numbers in Calculations
### Change in Exchange Rate  
   $$ 
   \Delta ER = 1.05 - 1.10 = -0.05 
   $$  
   **The negative value indicates a depreciation of the euro.**  

---

# Step 1: Working with Negative Numbers (cont)
## Using Negative Numbers in Calculations (cont)

### Change in Debt Due to Depreciation 
   - Before depreciation:  
     $$ D_{\text{old}} = \frac{1,000,000}{1.10} = 909,091 \text{ EUR} $$
   - After depreciation:  
     $$ D_{\text{new}} = \frac{1,000,000}{1.05} = 952,381 \text{ EUR} $$
   - **Increase in debt** (using subtraction):  
     $$ \Delta D = 909,091 - 952,381 = - 43,290 \text{ EUR} $$  
   - Since the result is **negative** *(old-new)*, this means the company **owes more** after depreciation.  

---

# Step 1: Working with Negative Numbers (cont)
## Using Negative Numbers in Calculations (cont)


### Multiplying Negative Numbers: Predicting Future Losses

- Suppose the **exchange rate continues to drop** at a rate of **-0.05 per year**.  
- If the debt increase last time was **43,290 EUR**, what happens **after 3 years**?  
  $$
  \text{Total Debt Increase} = \Delta D \times (-3)
  $$  
  $$
  = 43,290 \times (-3) = -129,870 \text{ EUR}
  $$  

 **The negative result means the companyâ€™s debt grows significantly due to continuous depreciation.**  

 ### Practice: Please calculate the debt increase after 5 years.

---

# Step 1: Working with Negative Numbers (cont)
## Using Negative Numbers in Calculations (cont)

### Dividing Negative Numbers: Recalculating Exchange Rate Risk

- If the euro depreciation of **-0.05 per year** continues, how many years until the exchange rate drops to **â‚¬1 = $0.85**?  
- Given the total depreciation needed:  
  $$
  \text{Total Change} = 1.05 - 0.85 = 0.20
  $$  
- Solve for time:  
  $$
  \text{Years} = \frac{\text{Total Change}}{\text{Annual Change}} = \frac{0.20}{-0.05} = -4
  $$  
 
  **Since time cannot be negative, this means in 4 years, the exchange rate could reach â‚¬1 = $0.85 if depreciation continues.**  

 ### Practice: Please calculate the time needed for the exchange rate to drop to â‚¬1 = $0.75.


---

# Step 2: Understanding algebraic expressions &amp; evaluating numerically 

## The Companyâ€™s Debt Formula

The company's debt can be represented by the following **algebraic expression**:  
$$
D = \frac{L}{ER}
$$  

Where:  
- \( D \) = Debt in euros (â‚¬)  
- \( L \) = Loan amount in dollars ($)  
- \( ER \) = Exchange rate (â‚¬ per $)  

---

# Step 2: Understanding algebraic expressions &amp; evaluating numerically (cont)

## Evaluating the Expression Numerically  

### Case 1: Initial Exchange Rate

If:  
- L = 1,000,000 USD  
- ER = 1.20 

Then:  
$$
D = \frac{1,000,000}{1.20}
$$  
$$
= 833,333 \text{ EUR}
$$  

 ### Practice: Please calculate the debt amount when the exchange rate is \( ER = 0.95 \).

---

# Step 3: Simplifying Expressions by Collecting Like Terms 

## Interest Payments on a Loan  

The bank considers **interest payments** when determining the total amount to be repaid.  

The formula for total repayment is:  
$$
T = P + rP
$$  

Where:  
- \( T \) = Total repayment  
- \( P \) = Principal loan amount  
- \( r \) = Interest rate  

---

# Step 3: Simplifying Expressions by Collecting Like Terms (cont)

## Simplifying the Expression  

If the interest rate is **5%** (**r = 0.05 **), substitute the value into the equation:  

$$
T = P + 0.05P
$$


Now, **factor out \( P \) (collecting like terms)**:  

$$
T = (1 + 0.05)P
$$


$$
T = 1.05P
$$


**This simplified formula helps calculate interest payments efficiently in banking.**  

## Practice: Please calculate the total repayment when the principal loan amount is \( P = 250,000 \).

---

# Step 4: Multiplying Out Brackets

- The company signs a **hedging contract** to manage exchange rate risk:  

$$
C = (D + F)(1 + r)
$$  

Where:  
- \( C \) = Cost of the contract  
- \( D \) = Debt in euros  
- \( F \) = Fixed fee for hedging. Assumed to be financed by the bank (incl. in loan).  
- \( r \) = Interest rate 


---

# Step 4: Multiplying Out Brackets (cont)

## Expanding the Brackets

Using the **distributive property** to expand:  

$$
C = D(1 + r) + F(1 + r)
$$


Expanding each term:  

$$
C = D \times 1 + D \times r + F \times 1 + F \times r
$$


$$
C = D + Dr + F + Fr
$$


---
# Step 4: Multiplying Out Brackets (cont)

## Final Expression: Total Cost Breakdown  

$$
C = (D + F) + (D + F)r
$$


ðŸ”¹ **First part (D + F)** represents the original debt and fee.  
ðŸ”¹ **Second part (D + F)r** represents the additional cost due to interest.  

**This expanded formula helps in accurately calculating the total cost, including fees and interest.**  

&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
.smaller-font {
  font-size: 18px;
}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;div class="smaller-font"&gt;
Note: hedging contract includes forward contract (F) to lock in exchange rate.
&lt;/div&gt;

## Practice: Please calculate the total cost when the debt is \( D = 1,000,000 \), fee is \( F = 50,000 \), and interest rate is \( r = 0.05 \).

---

# Step 5: Factorizing Expressions

- The bank wants to **simplify the total cost formula** for easier calculations:  

$$
C = D(1 + r) + F(1 + r)
$$ 

**We notice that** \( 1 + r \) **is a common factor in both terms.**  

- Since \( 1 + r \) appears in both terms, we can **factor it out**:  

$$
C = (D + F)(1 + r)
$$

**This simplifies the formula and makes calculations easier when adjusting values.**  

## Practice: Please factorize the expression \( T = P + 0.05P \).

---

# Step 6: Fractions in Loan Payments &amp; Risk Calculation 

## Quarterly Loan Payments 

If a **$1,000,000 loan** is split into **quarterly payments**, each payment is calculated as:  

$$
P = \frac{1,000,000}{4}
$$ 


## Converting Payments to Euros (â‚¬)  

If the company **pays in euros**, and the exchange rate is **â‚¬1 = $1.10**, the payment in euros is:  
$$
P_{\text{EUR}} = \frac{250,000}{1.10}
$$

Simplifying the fraction:  
$$
P_{\text{EUR}} = \frac{250,000 \div 10}{1.10 \div 10} = \frac{25,000}{0.11} = 227,273  \text{ EUR}
$$

**Each quarterly payment costs â‚¬227,273 at an exchange rate of 1.10.**  

---
# Step 6: Fractions in Loan Payments &amp; Risk Calculation (cont)

## Impact of Exchange Rate Drop 

If the exchange rate **drops to 1.05**:  

$$
P_{\text{EUR}} = \frac{250,000}{1.05}
$$

Simplifying:  

$$
P_{\text{EUR}} = \frac{250,000 \times 100}{1.05 \times 100} = \frac{25,000,000}{105} = 238,095  \text{ EUR}
$$

**Now, each quarterly payment costs â‚¬238,095.**  

---
# Step 6: Fractions in Loan Payments &amp; Risk Calculation (cont)

## Increase in Payment Due to Exchange Rate Change

$$
\Delta P_{\text{EUR}} = 238,095 - 227,273
$$

$$
= 10,822 \text{ EUR}
$$

**The company must now pay an additional â‚¬10,822 per quarter due to currency depreciation.**  

---

# Step 6: Fractions in Loan Payments &amp; Risk Calculation (cont)

## Multiplying Fractions â€“ Adjusting Loan Payments  

If the bank charges a **processing fee of 1/200 (0.5%)** on each quarterly payment, the extra fee per quarter is:  

$$
F = P_{\text{EUR}} \times \frac{1}{200}
$$

$$
F = \frac{238,095}{200}
$$

- Divide numerator and denominator by 5:  
$$
\frac{47,619}{40} = 1,190
$$  

**The additional fee per quarter is â‚¬1,190.**  

## Practice: Please calculate the processing fee if the quarterly payment is â‚¬200,000.

---

# Step 7: Solving Equations for Loan Repayment 

## Loan Repayment Over 5 Years

The company wants to **repay the loan over 5 years** with equal annual payments.  

The total loan amount is **$1,000,000**, and the **annual payment is \( P \)**.  

### The equation for equal payments 

$$
1,000,000 = 5P
$$

### Solving for \( P \) (Annual Payment)

To isolate \( P \), **divide both sides by 5**:  

$$
P = \frac{1,000,000}{5} = 200,000 \text{ USD}
$$

**Each annual payment is $200,000.**  

## Practice: Please calculate the annual payment if the total loan amount is $500,000 and the repayment period is 3 years.

---

# Step 8: Linear Inequalities in Risk Management


## Recognizing Inequality Symbols

The following symbols are used in **risk management** and **financial decision-making**:  

| Symbol | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `$$&lt;$$` | Less than | Profit \( &lt; 100,000 \) (profit is below â‚¬100K) |
| `$$&gt;$$` | Greater than | Revenue \( &gt; 500,000 \) (revenue exceeds â‚¬500K) |
| `$$\leq$$` | Less than or equal to | Risk score `$$\leq 70$$` (acceptable risk level) |
| `$$\geq$$` | Greater than or equal to | Capital reserves `$$\geq 1,000,000$$` (must maintain reserves of â‚¬1M or more) |

---

# Step 8: Linear Inequalities in Risk Management (cont)

## Bank's Risk Threshold Example

The bank considers a loan **risky** if the company's **annual revenue falls below â‚¬900,000**.  

Thus, the company's revenue must satisfy the inequality:  

$$
R - C \geq 900,000
$$  

Where:  
- \( R \) = Annual revenue  
- \( C \) = Annual costs  
- \( 900,000 \) = Minimum revenue required to avoid risk  

---
# Step 8: Linear Inequalities in Risk Management (cont)

## Solving the Inequality for Minimum Required Revenue 

If the company has **annual costs of â‚¬150,000**, we substitute \( C = 150,000 \):  

$$
R - 150,000 \geq 900,000
$$

To isolate \( R \), **add 150,000 to both sides**:  

$$
R \geq 1,050,000
$$

**The company must earn at least â‚¬1.05M per year to remain financially stable.**  

## Practice: Please solve the inequality for a minimum revenue of â‚¬1,200,000 if costs are â‚¬250,000.

---
# Step 8: Linear Inequalities in Risk Management (cont)

## Graphical Representation of the Inequality 

The inequality $$ R \geq 1,050,000 $$ can be visualized on a number line:  

- **Red region**: Revenue below â‚¬1.05M (Risky )  
- **Green region**: Revenue â‚¬1.05M or more (Safe)  

$$
\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}
{\color{red} \bullet} &amp; {\color{red} \bullet} &amp; {\color{red} \bullet} &amp; {\color{red} \bullet} &amp; {\color{black} |} &amp; {\color{green} \bullet} &amp; {\color{green} \bullet} &amp; {\color{green} \bullet} &amp; {\color{green} \bullet} &amp; {\color{green} \bullet} &amp; \cdots \\
\cdots &amp; \mathit{900K} &amp; \mathit{950K} &amp; \mathit{1M} &amp;  \mathbf{1.05M} &amp; \mathit{1.1M} &amp; \mathit{1.2M} &amp; \mathit{1.3M} &amp; \cdots \\
\end{array}
$$

**The company must be in the green region to meet the bank's stability requirements.**
