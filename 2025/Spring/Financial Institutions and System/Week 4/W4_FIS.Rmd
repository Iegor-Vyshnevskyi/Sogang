# 1. What is an Interest Rate?  

---

## **Interest Rates: The Cost of Money**

**Definition**: The **interest rate** is the **price of borrowing money** or the **return earned from lending or saving money**.

**Why it matters**: It affects everything—from mortgages and student loans to investment decisions and inflation.

**Interest rate** = **Risk-free rate** + **Risk premium**

where, **Risk-free rate** = **Real rate** + **Expected inflation**

Note: 
- **Real rate** is the rate of return on an investment after adjusting for inflation. 
- Expected inflation is the rate at which prices are expected to rise. 
- Risk-free rate is the return on an investment that carries no risk of financial loss.
- Risk premium is the return in excess of the risk-free rate.

---

## Measuring Interest Rates

**Present Value (PV)**: Reflects the idea that **money today is worth more than money in the future**.

- A dollar today earns interest and grows to $1 \times (1+i)$ tomorrow.
- Ex: Would you prefer \$20M **today**, or \$1M every year for 20 years?

The answer depends on the **discount rate** or interest rate used.

---

## Compound Interest Example

Let `i = 0.10` (10%)

- Year 1: $$ $100 × (1 + 0.10) = $110 $$
- Year 2: $$ $110 × (1 + 0.10) = $121 → or $100 × (1 + 0.10)^2 $$
- Year 3: $$ $121 × (1 + 0.10) = $133 → or $100 × (1 + 0.10)^3 $$

**General formula**: $FV = PV \times (1 + i)^n$

---

## Simple Present Value

$PV = \frac{CF}{(1 + i)^n}$

Where:
- **PV** = Present Value
- **CF** = Future Cash Flow
- **i** = Interest Rate
- **n** = Time in years

.center[<img src="pv.jpg" height="50%" width="50%">]

This formula helps us **compare money received at different times**.

---

## How Much Is That Jackpot Worth?

You win $20M, paid as $1M per year for 20 years.

- Is it really worth $20M today?
- Let’s assume an interest rate of 10%.

Calculate Present Value:

$PV = \frac{1M}{(1 + 0.10)} + \frac{1M}{(1 + 0.10)^2} + \ldots + \frac{1M}{(1 + 0.10)^{20}}$

This will result in a value significantly **less** than $20M. That’s the power of **discounting**.

---

## Four Types of Credit Market Instruments

1. **Simple Loan**: Lump sum borrowed and repaid with interest (e.g., short-term bank loan).

2. **Fixed Payment Loan**: Equal regular payments (e.g., car loans, mortgages).

3. **Coupon Bond**: Pays fixed interest (coupon) annually + face value at maturity.
   - **Coupon rate** = Annual coupon ÷ Face value
   - **Zero-coupon bonds**: No interim payments, only repayment at maturity.

4. **Discount Bond**: Sold below face value, pays no coupon (e.g., Treasury bills).

---

## Yield to Maturity (YTM)

YTM is the interest rate that **equates the bond’s current price with the present value of its future payments**.

### Why is YTM important?
- It reflects the **true return** on a bond if held to maturity.

**Example – Simple Loan**:
- PV = $100
- CF = $110 in 1 year

$100 = \frac{110}{1 + i} \Rightarrow i = 10%$

---

## Fixed Payment Loan Formula

$LV = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{FP}{(1 + i)^t}$

Where:
- **LV** = Loan Value
- **FP** = Fixed annual payment
- **n** = Number of years

Used in amortized loans like mortgages.

---

## Coupon Bond Formula

$$ P = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{C}{(1 + i)^t} + \frac{F}{(1 + i)^n} $$

Where:
- **P** = Current bond price
- **C** = Annual coupon payment
- **F** = Face value
- **i** = Interest rate
- **n** = Years to maturity

---

## Bond Pricing Insights

- **YTM = Coupon Rate** → Bond trades at **par** (face value).
- **YTM > Coupon Rate** → Bond trades **below par** (discount).
- **YTM < Coupon Rate** → Bond trades **above par** (premium).

.center[<img src="tab1.jpg" height="50%" width="50%">]

Remember: Bond price and Yield to Maturity (YTM) are inversely related — when price increases, yield decreases.

Why? Because paying a higher price for the same fixed future payments results in a lower return.

---

## Consol (Perpetuity)

A **consol bond** or **perpetuity** pays **coupon payments forever** and never matures.

$$ P = \frac{C}{i_c} $$

Where:
- **P** = Price
- **C** = Annual coupon
- **i_c** = Current yield

Used as a **simple approximation** of YTM when maturity is distant.

---

## Discount Bond Formula

$$ i = \frac{F - P}{P} $$

Where:
- **F** = Face value
- **P** = Current price

Like other bonds, **price ↑ → yield ↓**.

---

## Interest Rates vs Returns

$RET = \frac{C}{P_t} + \frac{P_{t+1} - P_t}{P_t}$

Where:
- **RET** = Return from holding bond for 1 period
- **C** = Coupon payment
- $P_t$ = Price at time t
- $P_{t+1}$ = Price at time t+1

**Two components**:
1. **Current yield**
2. **Capital gain/loss**

---

## Return vs Yield

- Return equals YTM **only** if held to maturity.
- Longer maturity → **greater interest-rate risk**.
- If interest rates **rise**, prices fall → **capital loss**.

.center[<img src="tab2.jpg" height="60%" width="60%">]

---

## Interest-Rate Risk

- **Long-term bonds** are more sensitive to interest rate changes.

- If you sell before maturity → you face price risk.

- But if you hold to maturity, your return = YTM.

Rule: The longer the maturity, the **higher the volatility** of bond price.

---

## Real vs Nominal Interest Rates

- **Nominal rate (i)**: Not adjusted for inflation

- **Real rate (iᵣ)**: Adjusted for inflation

Types of real rates:
- **Ex ante**: Based on **expected inflation**

- **Ex post**: Based on **actual inflation**

---

## Fisher Equation

$$ i = i_r + \pi^e $$

Where:
- **i** = Nominal rate
- **iᵣ** = Real rate
- $\pi^e$ = Expected inflation

Low real rates → borrowing is cheap → **more demand for credit**

## Fed Commentary: Financial Stability Risks

- Fed has increased exams after Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapse.

- Issue: **Unrealized losses** on long-term assets due to rising rates.

- Banks now face **tighter supervision and capital requirements**.

Shows how **interest rate changes ripple through the financial system**.

# 2. The Behavior of Interest Rates

---

## Determinants of Asset Demand

An asset is anything that can be owned and has value.

Examples: money, laptops, cellphones, bonds, stocks, art, land, houses, and machinery.

**Asset demand** is the amount of an asset that people are willing to hold at a given price.

**Financial assets** are claims on real assets or income.

---

## Factors Affecting Asset Demand

- **Wealth**: Total resources, including all assets

- **Expected Return**: Return relative to other assets

- **Risk**: Uncertainty of returns

- **Liquidity**: Ease of converting to cash

---

## Theory of Portfolio Choice

1. Demand ↑ with **wealth**  

2. Demand ↑ with **expected return**  

3. Demand ↓ with **risk**  

4. Demand ↑ with **liquidity**

---

## Bond Market: Supply & Demand

- Lower price → Higher interest rate → Higher demand for bonds  

- Lower price → Higher interest rate → Lower supply of bonds

---

.center[<img src="fig1 (2).jpg" height="90%" width="90%">]

---

## Market Equilibrium in Bonds

- Market clears when: $B^d = B^s$

- $B^d > B^s$: Excess demand → Price ↑ → Interest rate ↓

- $B^d < B^s$: Excess supply → Price ↓ → Interest rate ↑

---

## Changes in Equilibrium Interest Rates

**Demand for Bonds Shifts:**
- ↑ Wealth → Demand ↑
- ↑ Expected interest rate → Demand ↓
- ↑ Expected inflation → Demand ↓
- ↑ Risk → Demand ↓
- ↑ Liquidity → Demand ↑

---

## Supply of Bonds Shifts

- ↑ Profitability → Supply ↑

- ↑ Expected inflation → Supply ↑

- ↑ Budget deficit → Supply ↑

---

## Expected Inflation vs Interest Rates (1953–2020)

.center[<img src="fig5.jpg" height="90%" width="90%">]


---

## Liquidity Preference Framework

- Keynesian model: equilibrium interest rate via money supply & demand

- Wealth held in either **money** or **bonds**

$B^s + M^s = B^d + M^d$
→ Rearranged: $B^s - B^d = M^s - M^d$

If $M^s = M^d$ → then $B^s = B^d$

---

## Demand for Money

As interest rate ↑:
- Opportunity cost of holding money ↑
- Expected return of money ↓
→ Demand for money ↓

Assume money supply is **fixed** by central bank.

Meaning:

- When interest rates go up:

You're missing out on more potential earnings by just holding onto cash — that’s the opportunity cost.

Since cash doesn’t earn interest, its return becomes less attractive compared to alternatives like bonds or savings accounts.

- Result: People prefer to hold less money and instead invest it — so the demand for money falls.

---

## Equilibrium in Money Market

.center[<img src="fig8.jpg" height="70%" width="70%">]

---

## Changes in Equilibrium (Liquidity Preference)

**Demand for Money Shifts:**
- **Income Effect**: ↑ income → ↑ money demand

- **Price-Level Effect**: ↑ prices → ↑ money demand

---

## Shifts in Supply of Money

- Central bank controls money supply

- Fed increases $M^s$ → Supply curve shifts **right**

---

## Money & Interest Rates

- Liquidity preference says ↑ $M^s$ → ↓ interest rate
- But...
    - **Price-level effect**: ↑ $M^s$ → ↑ prices → ↑ interest rate

---

## More Effects of Money Growth

- **Expected-inflation effect**: if people expect rising inflation, they demand higher interest

- **Income effect**: ↑ $M^s$ → ↑ income → ↑ interest

---

## Net Effect? Does ↑ Money Supply ↓ Rates?

- **Liquidity effect**: ↓ rates

- **Income effect**: ↑ rates

- **Price-level effect**: ↑ rates

- **Expected-inflation effect**: ↑ rates
