# 1. The Foreign Exchange Market

---

# Introduction

**Welcome to the Foreign Exchange Market!**

- How does the exchange rate affect international trade?

- What determines exchange rates in the long run and short run?

- What role do interest rates play in exchange rate movements?

---

# Definition and Importance

.center[
**What is the Foreign Exchange Market?**
]

- A market where different currencies are traded.

- Composed of banks, corporations, governments, and traders.

- Major transactions include:
  - Spot transactions: Immediate exchange of currencies.
  - Forward transactions: Agreement to exchange currencies at a future date.

- Facilitates international trade and investment by allowing for currency exchange.
- Influences import/export prices, financial flows, and investment decisions.
- Affects inflation, interest rates, and economic growth.

**Who benefits the most and why?**

# Key Terminologies

- **Exchange Rate (E):** The price of one currency in terms of another.

- **Spot Exchange Rate:** Rate for immediate exchange.

- **Forward Exchange Rate:** Rate for future exchange.

- **Effective Exchange Rate Index:** Weighted average of exchange rates with major trading partners.

---

# Spot vs. Forward Exchange Rates

.center[<img src="p4.png" height="70%" width="70%">]

- The dynamic of the spot and forward exchange rates is determined by the interest rate differential between the two currencies involved in the transaction.


---

# Types of FX Transactions

- **Spot Transactions:** Immediate exchange of currencies at the current rate.

- **Forward Transactions:** Agreement to exchange currencies at a future date.

- **Swaps:** Exchange of currencies and interest rates between two parties.

- **Options:** Contracts granting the right to buy/sell at a specific rate.

**Why might a firm prefer a forward over a spot transaction?**

---
# Real vs. Nominal Exchange Rates

**Nominal Exchange Rate (E):** The price of one currency in terms of another.

**Real Exchange Rate (Er):** Adjusts the nominal rate for price level differences.

$$E_r = \frac{E \times P_{HC}}{P_{ROW}}$$

Where:
- $E$ = Nominal Exchange Rate
- $P_{HC}$ = Price level in Home Country
- $P_{ROW}$ = Price level in Rest of the World

---

# Example: Real Exchange Rate Calculation

- HC: USA, ROW: Japan
- Exchange Rate (E): 1.5 yen/USD
- Price of U.S. wheat: 2 USD per bushel
- Price of Japanese wheat: 4 yen per bushel

$$ E_r = \frac{1.5 \times 2}{4} = 0.75 $$

Interpretation: 1 bushel of U.S. wheat costs 0.75 bushels of Japanese wheat.

---

# Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)

- PPP states that identical goods should cost the same in different countries when expressed in a common currency.

$$E \times P = P_{ROW}$$

Example: Big Mac Index

- If a Big Mac costs $5 in the USA and 500 yen in Japan, the implied PPP exchange rate is 500 / 5 = 100 yen/USD.

---

# Interest Rate Parity (IRP)

- **Interest Parity:** The relationship between interest rates and exchange rates.

- IRP states that the difference in interest rates between two countries is equal to the expected change in exchange rates.

- It ensures that arbitrage opportunities are eliminated.

- IRP connects exchange rates and interest rates across countries.

$$i_{HC} - i_{ROW} = \frac{E(T+1) - E(T)}{E(T)}$$

- If domestic interest rates rise, the currency is expected to appreciate.

---

# Wrap-Up and Discussion

- What determines exchange rates in the short run and long run?

- How do interest rates and inflation impact exchange rates?

- How can businesses hedge against exchange rate risks?


---

# Closing and Q&A

- Key Takeaways:
  - FX markets are essential for global trade and investment.
  - Exchange rates are influenced by interest rates, inflation, and market expectations.
  - PPP and interest parity provide frameworks but have limitations.

# 2. The International Financial System

---

# Introduction to the International Financial System

- Overview of National Income and Product Accounting in an Open Economy

- Understanding the Balance of Payments

- Role of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)

---

# National Income and Product Accounting for an Open Economy

- Distinguish between GNP and GDP:

  - **GNP**: Total value of final goods/services produced using HC-owned factors of production.
  - **GDP**: Total value of final goods/services produced within the borders of the HC.

- Key Formula:
  
  `GNP(T) = GDP(T) + NFP(T)`

  - **NFP(T)**: Net factor payments from ROW to HC.

# National Income Accounting Identity

- National Income Accounting Identity:
  
  `GDP(T) = C(T) + I(T) + G(T) + NE(T)`

- Key Terms:
  - **C(T)**: Consumption Expenditure
  - **I(T)**: Investment Expenditure
  - **G(T)**: Government Expenditure
  - **NE(T)**: Net Exports (EX - IM)

---

# Example of GNP and GDP Calculation

- Suppose a country produces:
  - $100 million worth of goods/services domestically (GDP)
  - $20 million received as income from abroad
  - $10 million paid to foreign factors

- GNP Calculation:

  `GNP = 100 + (20 - 10) = 110 million`

---

# Balance of Payments: Definition and Structure

- BOP Accounts:

  1. Current Account (CA): Net exports, factor income, transfers
  2. Capital and Financial Account (KFA): Asset transfers and financial transactions
  3. Official Reserve Transactions

- BOP Identity:
  
  `BOP = CA + KFA`

# Role of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)

- Established in 1944 as part of the Bretton Woods Agreement

# IMF Controversies and Criticism

- Criticisms of IMF Interventions:
  - Potential inflationary impact

- The Balance of Payments provides insight into a country's financial position relative to the world.

- The IMF plays a critical role in maintaining international financial stability.
