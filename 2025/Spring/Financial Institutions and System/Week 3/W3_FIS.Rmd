Salt is one of the world‚Äôs oldest forms of payment. 
In fact, the word salary derives from the Latin ‚Äúsalarium,‚Äù which was the money paid to Roman soldiers to buy salt. 
It was the main form of currency in the Sahara Desert during the Middle Ages, and was used extensively throughout East Africa. 
Typically, one would lick a salt block to make sure it was real and break off pieces to make change.

## **Measuring Money: Monetary Aggregates**  

**How do we measure money?**  

üîπ **M1 (Most Liquid Assets)**  
- **Currency + Traveler‚Äôs Checks + Demand Deposits + Other Checkable Deposits**  

üîπ **M2 (Less Liquid Assets)**  
- **M1 + Savings Deposits + Small-Time Deposits + Money Market Accounts + Mutual Funds**

## **Monetary Aggregates Over Time**  

<div>
.center[<img src="monagg.jpg" height="50%" width="50%">]


**M1 vs. M2: Why does it matter?**  
- If M1 and M2 move **together**, choosing a measure is less important.  
- But when they diverge, **monetary policy decisions become more complex**.  

*Conclusion*: the choice of monetary aggregate is important for policymakers.

# 2. Class Discussion: The Evolution of Money

### **Discussion & Brainstorming**  
**Topic:** *The Evolution of Money*  

**Key Questions:**  
1. Looking at historical examples (cows, salt, shells, etc.), what characteristics made them function as money?  
2. Which of these forms of money do you think was the most effective? Why?  
3. Why did societies move from commodity money (gold, salt, etc.) to fiat money (paper currency)?  
4. Could any of the ancient money forms still work today in certain economies?  
5. Why was wampum valuable to some societies but meaningless to others?  
6. Do you think the perception of cryptocurrency is cultural, just like historical money?  
7. Will central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) replace cash?  
8. If you had to design a new form of money, what qualities would it need to be widely accepted?  
9. What lessons can we learn from historical money that might help us understand Bitcoin & cryptocurrencies?
