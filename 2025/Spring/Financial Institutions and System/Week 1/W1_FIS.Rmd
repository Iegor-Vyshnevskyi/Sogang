# Teaching method

This course follows a **flipped classroom approach**, where students are expected to complete assigned readings before class. Each session is usually structured as follows:  
- *Hour 1*: Brief Lecture – A concise overview of key concepts from the readings.  
- *Hour 2*: Practical Application – Hands-on exercises, case studies, and data analysis.  
- *Hour 3*: Interactive Activities – Debates, discussions, simulations, and policy analysis.  

This format fosters active learning, critical thinking, and engagement with current issues in the field.

On national or university’s holidays (March 28 and June 6), recorded lecture/materials/assignments will be provided on the course website. Students should complete that by the end of the week.
