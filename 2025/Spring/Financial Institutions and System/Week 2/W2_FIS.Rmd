# 1. An Overview of the Financial System  

---

## Function of Financial Markets  

- Channel funds from economic players with **surplus funds** to those in need.  
- **Direct finance**: Borrowers sell **securities** directly to lenders.  

### Why is this important?  
- **Promotes economic efficiency** by ensuring capital allocation.  
- **Improves consumer well-being** by optimizing purchase timing.  
- **Enhances economic growth** by making capital available to productive investments.  

**Key Activities in Financial Markets:**  
- Facilitate the trading of **bonds and stocks**.  
- Affect **personal wealth, business growth, and economic stability**.  
- Play a crucial role during **financial crises**, impacting economies worldwide.

## Structure of Financial Markets  

### Two Ways to Obtain Funds  
1. **Debt Markets**  
   - Borrowers issue **debt instruments** (loans, bonds) with fixed payments.  
   - **Maturity**: The number of years until repayment.  
   - **Short-term vs. long-term debt instruments**.  

2. **Equity Markets**  
   - Investors hold **shares** in a company’s net income and assets.  
   - **Dividends, voting rights**, and ownership advantages.  
   - **Residual claimants** – Equity holders get paid after debt holders.  

---

## Debt vs. Equity  

- **Debt holders** receive fixed payments and get priority over equity holders.  
- **Equity holders** benefit from increases in the corporation’s profitability.  
- **Key differences:** Risk, ownership rights, and potential returns.  

<div>
.center[<img src="p1.png" height="50%" width="50%">]

---

## Primary and Secondary Markets  

- **Primary Market**  
  - New securities are sold to initial buyers (e.g., **IPOs**).  
  - Investment banks **underwrite** securities.  
  - Transactions are **not open to the public**.  

- **Secondary Market**  
  - Securities that have been previously issued are **resold**.  
  - **Brokers** match buyers with sellers.  
  - **Dealers** buy and sell securities at stated prices.  
  - Helps in **price discovery and liquidity provision**.  

---

## Why Secondary Markets Matter  

- **Firms raise funds only in the primary market**, but...  
- Secondary markets:  
  - **Improve liquidity** (easier buying and selling).  
  - **Determine security prices**, impacting primary market valuations.  
  - Support **financial stability and investment decisions**.  

---

## Types of Secondary Markets  

1. **Exchanges** – Buyers and sellers meet at a centralized location.  
   - *Examples:* NYSE, Chicago Board of Trade.  

2. **Over-the-Counter (OTC) Markets** – Dealers buy and sell securities remotely.  
   - *Examples:* Foreign Exchange (Forex), Federal Funds market.  
   - Operate **without centralized exchanges**.  

---

## Money and Capital Markets  

- **Money Market** – Short-term debt instruments, high liquidity.  
- **Capital Market** – Long-term debt and equity securities.  

**Why it matters?**  
- Money markets provide short-term funding for corporations and governments.  
- Capital markets allow firms to finance **long-term growth and investment**.  

---

## Financial Market Instruments  

<div>
.center[<img src="tab1.jpg" height="90%" width="90%">]

---

## Internationalization of Financial Markets  

- **Foreign Bonds** – Issued in a foreign country in that country’s currency.  

- **Eurobonds** – Issued in a currency **other than** the country’s own.  

- **Eurocurrencies** – Deposited foreign currencies outside their home country.  
  - *Example:* **Eurodollars** – USD deposits in non-U.S. banks.  

- **Increasing integration of global financial markets** impacts monetary policy worldwide.  

---

## Financial Intermediaries: Indirect Finance  

- **Financial intermediaries** connect savers with borrowers.  

- **Reduce asymmetric information problems** in markets.  

- Primary route for **fund transfers** in financial markets.  

### Why Important?  
- **Lower transaction costs** and improve **efficiency**.  

- **Facilitate risk sharing** through financial instruments.  

---

## Transaction Costs & Risk  

- **Transaction costs** – Time and money spent in financial transactions.  
  - **Economies of scale** lower costs for intermediaries.  

- **Risk** – Uncertainty of investment returns.  
  - Financial institutions **diversify risk** through asset transformation.  

---

## Asymmetric Information  

- **One party has more knowledge than the other.**  

- **Financial intermediaries help by:**  
  - **Adverse Selection** – Screening risky borrowers before lending.  
  - **Moral Hazard** – Ensuring borrowers act responsibly **after** receiving funds.  

---

## Types of Financial Intermediaries  

- **Depository Institutions** – Banks, credit unions, savings associations.  

- **Contractual Savings Institutions** – Pension funds, insurance companies.  

- **Investment Intermediaries** – Mutual funds, hedge funds, venture capital firms.

## Regulation of the Financial System  

### Why regulate financial markets?  
1. **Increase transparency** for investors.  

2. **Ensure financial system stability**.  

3. **Protect consumers from fraud and mismanagement**.
